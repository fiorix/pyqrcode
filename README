 
 README file for pyqrcode
 ------------------------

 pyqrcode is a python extension for encoding and decoding
 the popular matrix code created by the Japanese
 corporation Denso-Wave, known as qrcode.

 The encoder is based on Fukuchi Kentaro's libqrencode,
 with a small python hack from Stefano Pedemonte's
 PyQrCodec.

 On the other hand, the decoder is based on the best free
 and open source qrcode decoder written by Yusuke Yanbe,
 in java. It's built with Andi Vajda's JCC.
